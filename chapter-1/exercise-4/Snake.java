/*
* 1/A - If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 2; the code will compile (True)
*	In this case, the class Snake would have the instance property result which would then be initilized with "done", and the shed instance method would have proper access to property, so yes, it would get compiled properly.
* 2/B - If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 4; the code will compile (True)
*	In this case, the result would be a local variable properly initialized, so yes, it would work properly.
* 3/C - If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 6, the code will compile (False)
*	In this case, the result would be a local variable within the if block, and outside this block, it would be expected the result variable, so the code wouln't compile.
* 4/D - If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 9, the code will compile (False)
*	In this case, the variable would be already expected on line 8, so the code wouldn't compile.
* 5/E - None of the above changes will make the code compile (False)
